# @ursif/restful-interfaces

## Overview

This project showcases how to create a RESTful interface on top of a PostgresDB.

## Adding Routes

Once you have created the tables inside of your Postgres instance, you can add
the table names to the `routes` array inside of `src/index.js` that is passed to
the `rest` worker.
